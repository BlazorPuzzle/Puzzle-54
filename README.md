### The Challenge:

This is an interesting demo where we are tracking user activity.

Navigate to the TimerDemo page.

If you don't move your mouse or press a key for 5 seconds, you will see a warning message.

You can watch the console messages in the console window.

However, if you move your mouse inside an iframe, the timer never resets.

Once the time is up, you will have to refresh the page to test it again.

How can we make the events happen inside the iframe?
