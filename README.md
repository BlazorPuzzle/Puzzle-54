### The Challenge:

This is an interesting demo where we are tracking user activity.

Navigate to the Timer Demo page, which shows some content and also the Weather page inside an `<iframe>` element.

If you don't move your mouse or press a key for 5 seconds, you will see a warning message.

However, if you move your mouse inside the `<iframe>`, the timer never resets.

Once the time is up, you will have to refresh the page to test it again.

How can we capture the events inside the `<iframe>`?
